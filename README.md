# Stars Compass
An Android application that allow the user to target a planet from his current position.

I've created this application for personnal use to be able to target any planet with a minimalist compass.

This app can be use to place your telescope in the right position, because the app target a planet with the top of your smartphone ! not with back of your phone.

With this feature you have the feeling to target a planet with your finger.
